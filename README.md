# 3d-visualization-of-requests-library-code-proficiency
his project visualizes Python proficiency levels in Requests Library .py files as a 3D cityscape using A-Frame. Folders are blocks, .py files are buildings, and floor heights/colors represent proficiency levels (e.g., AB, C1, C2). Explore and understand the Python skills needed interactively.
